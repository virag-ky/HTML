Follow the instructions to submit the homework:

- If you haven't forked the repository yet:
  Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, then follow the steps below.
   
- If you already have the forked repository:
Sync the repository if there are changes in the upstream, then follow the steps below.


1. Make sure you are in the links folder
1. Create a new branch (git branch "branch_name")
2. Switch to the new branch (git checkout -b "branch_name")
3. Create another folder inside the links folder with your GitHub username or regular name
4. Create an index.html file
5. Add the HTML boilerplate (if you don't know what's this then have a look at the first HTML video: [HTML boilerplate + head element](https://youtu.be/q989wUBLq-4?si=xSPezy-hjJAWBXd3))
6. Inside the body, add an absolute link that goes to any website (should open in a new tab), add a relative link that goes to another section on the same page, and add 2-3 relative links that go to other pages (e.g. about/contact page)
7. Make sure to set up the other pages either inside the same folder or create another folder for them (as in the video) and add the HTML boilerplate, an h1 element, and a relative link that goes back to the index.html page
8. Add the modified file to the next stage (git add "file_name")
9. Make a commit (git commit -m "message")
10. Push the changes to your fork (git push origin "your_branch_name")
11. Create a pull request
12. Wait for the feedback
