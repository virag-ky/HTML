Follow the instructions to submit the homework:

- If you haven't forked the repository yet:
  Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, then follow the steps below.
   
- If you already have the forked repository:
Sync the repository if there are changes in the upstream, then follow the steps below.

1. Make sure you are in the lists folder
1. Create a new branch (git branch "branch_name")
2. Switch to the new branch (git checkout -b "branch_name")
3. Create another folder inside the paragraphs-headings folder with your GitHub username or regular name
4. Create an index.html file
5. Add the HTML boilerplate (if you don't know what's this then have a look at the first HTML video: [HTML boilerplate + head element](https://youtu.be/q989wUBLq-4?si=xSPezy-hjJAWBXd3))
6. Inside the body, add an unordered list with at least 3 list items, add an ordered list with at least 3 list items, add a description list with at least 3 list terms/descriptions, and add another ordered list with a nested unordered list inside of it
9. Add the modified file to the next stage (git add "file_name")
10. Make a commit (git commit -m "message")
11. Push the changes to your fork (git push origin "your_branch_name")
12. Create a pull request
13. Wait for the feedback
