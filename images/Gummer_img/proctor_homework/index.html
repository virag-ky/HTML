    <p>But it was the, er... the most cheerful song I could find in the Vulcan database. Capt. Kirk: You'd make a
        splendid computer, Mr Spock. Spock Spock: [taken aback] That is very kind of you, Captain! [convinced he's
        dying] Tom Paris: Here lies Thomas Eugene Paris, beloved mutant. The Doctor: You're too stubborn to die, Mr.
        Paris. [Neelix is throwing assorted cooking implements at an invading Kazon soldier] Neelix: I hope that crushed
        your skull, Kazon pus-hog! B'Elanna Torres: How the hell do you know when we're having intimate relations? Seven
        of Nine: There is no one on deck 9 section 12 who does not know when you're having intimate relations. Captain
        Janeway: I have a boyfriend that malfunctions. Chief O'Brien: Four weeks! Are you telling me I've been hanging
        around a Changeling for over a month? Doctor Bashir: And you never suspected it wasn't me? Tom Paris: If you
        hear muffled screams, consider that a request for a beam out. Seven of Nine: [to Janeway] Your attempts to
        assimilate this drone will fail. You can alter our physiology but you cannot change our nature. We will betray
        you. We are Borg. [the Doctor sees the bridge for the first time] The Doctor: Well... it's bigger than I
        thought.</p>

    <p>Captain Janeway: We're Starfleet officers. Weird is part of the job. Chief O'Brien: Four weeks! Are you telling
        me I've been hanging around a Changeling for over a month? Doctor Bashir: And you never suspected it wasn't me?
        Capt. Kirk: You'd make a splendid computer, Mr Spock. Spock Spock: [taken aback] That is very kind of you,
        Captain! Leonardo da Vinci hologram: There are times, Catarina, when I find myself transfixed by a shadow on the
        wall, or the splashing of water on a stone. I stare at it, the hours pass. The world around me drops away,
        replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination. [Talking about the hologram she has become
        interested in] Captain Janeway: You know the story. Girl meets boy, girl changes boy's subroutines. Harry Kim:
        That'll tear the ship apart. Chakotay: Then tear her apart! Seven of Nine: Two hours, thirty seven minutes,
        thirteen seconds. Tuvok: [puzzled look] Seven of Nine: That's how long we've gone without verbal communication.
        Tuvok: Why is that remarkable? Seven of Nine: The doctor encourages me to engage in conversation during awkward
        silences. Tuvok: Did you find the silence awkward? Seven of Nine: No. Tuvok: Nor did I. The Doctor: All of us
        have violent instincts.</p>
