Follow the instructions to submit the homework:

- If you haven't forked the repository yet:
  Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, then follow the steps below.
   
- If you already have the forked repository:
Sync the repository if there are changes in the upstream, then follow the steps below.


1. Make sure you are in the images folder
1. Create a new branch (git branch "branch_name")
2. Switch to the new branch (git checkout -b "branch_name")
3. Create another folder inside the images folder with your GitHub username or regular name
4. Create an index.html file
5. Add the HTML boilerplate (if you don't know what's this then have a look at the first HTML video: [HTML boilerplate + head element](https://youtu.be/q989wUBLq-4?si=xSPezy-hjJAWBXd3))
6. Inside the body, add 2 images (you can use any images or from Unsplash), make sure you add the alt, width, and height attributes.
8. Add the modified file to the next stage (git add "file_name")
9. Make a commit (git commit -m "message")
10. Push the changes to your fork (git push origin "your_branch_name")
11. Create a pull request
12. Wait for the feedback
