**If you are new to Git and GitHub then make sure to check out my video: [Git and GitHub for absolute beginners](https://youtu.be/WaAsfuVDJ_U?si=q4UFgWQH-uWIMBUu)**

Follow the instructions to submit the homework:

- If you haven't forked the repository yet:
  Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, then follow the steps below.
   
- If you already have the forked repository:
Sync the repository if there are changes in the upstream, then follow the steps below.


 
1. Create a new branch (git branch "branch_name")
2. Switch to the new branch (git checkout -b "branch_name")
3. Create another folder with your GitHub username or regular name
4. Create an index.html file
5. Add the HTML boilerplate (try to create it by yourself)
6. Change the text in the title element
7. Add the modified file to the next stage (git add "file_name")
8. Make a commit (git commit -m "message")
9. Push the changes to your fork (git push origin "your_branch_name")
10. Create a pull request
